# Serial
This project is divided into two parts:
        1. Reading data from the Load cell(measuring weight) by using Arduino after this it sends the data from the Load cell to the USB port.
           For this, we require a specific library i.e HX711_ADC (if this is not present in your Arduino ide)
        2. Now, we read stream data from the serial(USB port) by the using Serial library of Python.
